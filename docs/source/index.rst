Welcome to FlexGridPy's documentation!
===================================

**FlexGridPy** is a Python library for researchers and engineers  
working on the intelligent operation of power systems.  
It provides modular tools for:

- building and tuning grey-box thermal models for residential buildings and heat pumps,
- optimizing electric vehicle (EV) and photovoltaic (PV) integration under flexibility constraints,
- modeling and solving convex and non-convex Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems,
- extracting, transforming, and forecasting environmental and operational data.

FlexGridPy is designed for **flexibility-aware modeling**, combining control, simulation, and optimization in a unified and extensible framework.

It integrates seamlessly with common open-source tools (e.g. Pyomo, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PandaPower)  
and supports scalable experiments for scientific publications, demo cases, and industrial applications.
