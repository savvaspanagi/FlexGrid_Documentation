RC Models
=========

Building RC (Resistance-Capacitance) models are fundamental to thermal building simulation in FlexGridPy.

Model Types
-----------

1R1C Model
~~~~~~~~~~

The 1R1C model represents a single-zone building with one thermal resistance and one thermal capacitance.

2R2C Model
~~~~~~~~~~

The 2R2C model extends the 1R1C model to include wall dynamics with two thermal resistances and two thermal capacitances.

Multi-zone Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Complex building representations with multiple thermal zones and inter-zone heat transfer.

Implementation
-------------

RC models in FlexGridPy are implemented using:

- Differential equation solvers
- Parameter estimation algorithms
- Integration with optimization frameworks

.. note::

   Detailed implementation examples will be provided in the examples section.
