Overview
========

Heat pump modeling and building RC (Resistance-Capacitance) modeling are core features of FlexGridPy, designed to provide accurate and computationally efficient representations of building thermal dynamics and heat pump performance.

Building RC Models
-----------------

Building RC models represent the thermal behavior of buildings using electrical circuit analogies:

- **Resistance (R):** Represents thermal resistance (walls, windows, insulation)
- **Capacitance (C):** Represents thermal mass (building materials, air)

These models are particularly useful for:
- Energy consumption prediction
- Thermal comfort analysis
- Building energy optimization
- Demand response studies

Heat Pump Modeling
-----------------

FlexGridPy includes detailed heat pump models that capture:

- **Performance Characteristics:** COP (Coefficient of Performance) curves
- **Thermal Dynamics:** Heat transfer processes
- **Control Strategies:** Operating modes and control algorithms
- **Integration:** Seamless integration with building models

Model Types
----------

1. **1R1C Model:** Simple single-zone thermal model
2. **2R2C Model:** Two-zone thermal model with wall dynamics
3. **Multi-zone Models:** Complex multi-room building representations
4. **Heat Pump Models:** Detailed heat pump performance models

Applications
-----------

- Building energy simulation
- Heat pump sizing and selection
