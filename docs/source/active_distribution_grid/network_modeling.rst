Network Modeling
===============

Distribution network modeling is a core capability of FlexGridPy for active distribution grid analysis.

Network Topology
---------------

FlexGridPy supports various network topologies:

- Radial networks
- Meshed networks
- Hybrid AC/DC networks
- Multi-voltage level networks

Component Models
---------------

1. **Lines and Cables:** Overhead lines and underground cables
2. **Transformers:** Distribution and power transformers
3. **Loads:** Residential, commercial, and industrial loads
4. **Switches:** Circuit breakers and disconnectors
5. **Capacitors:** Shunt capacitors for voltage support

Power Flow Analysis
------------------

- AC power flow calculations
- DC power flow approximations
- Unbalanced three-phase analysis
- Time-series power flow

.. note::

   Detailed implementation examples will be provided in the examples section.
